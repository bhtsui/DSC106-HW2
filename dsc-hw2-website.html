			<h2>Importance of Burgers</h2>
			<p>Beef has consistently represented the largest percentage of sandwhich
			sales across all regions consisting of 60% of all sales with hamburgers
			remaining the staple item of choice for McDonald's customers. We need to
			keep careful track of data relating to burger sales and think about ways
			to improve them potentially through the impossible burger.</p>

		<h2>What Does this Mean for the Impossible Burger?</h2>
		<p>Looking at the graphs, which contains sales data from the past year we notice a
		disturbing trend in the past 2 months. While overall sales are going up, we notice
		that hamburger sales in the NorthEast (NE) and Central (C) regions are on the decline. We know
		that this is not simply a sign of overall decline in sales from other factors because
		we see in the second graph that chicken and fish sales are going up in those regions.
		Looking closely at the data shows a 2.94% and 2.36% decline in hamburger sales in the
		NE and C regions. While the exact reason is difficult to extrapolate just from this data,
		we can still look to improve sales in these areas. This decline actually presents a good
		opportunity to add the impossible burger to our menu which can be tested in these regions with struggling
		burger sales. Rolling in the burger into these markets first will be able to test its popularity
		among a population which appears based on the data to be shifting away from beef consumption. Doing
		so will allow McDonald's to enter the market in plant based burgers which could not only boost
		sales, but also further bolsters some of McDonald's key food philosophies of "Commitment to Quality", 
		maintaining a "Variety of Choices", keeping up with an ever-changing society by being "Committed to Menu Evolution".</p>

		<h2>Weekly Sales Improvements</h2>
		<p>During my investigation, I looked at a microlevel at the sales data across days in a week
		and found an area of improvement. While as expected, there is variability in total sales across
		weeks in a month, each week had the same trend, sales on the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) as
		well on Tuesday were consistently lower than the rest of the week. In each of the 5 weeks sampled
		here, the three lowest totals were always on those three days of the week, with Saturday being
		especially weak. Though this data is from three years ago, these trends may still continue to this
		day. I would suggest looking more into the causes for these trends and look to improve sales on
		Tuesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
